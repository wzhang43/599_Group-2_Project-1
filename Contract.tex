We, the members of the smallest yet most awesome group, agree that we shall abide by the tenets set forth below. 

\subsection*{Stuff We Doth Agree-eth To. Eth.}

``I commit to a timely response to e-mail discussions, specifically, within 24 hours."

``I will commit to timely progress on individual tasks, and will inform the group if that is not possible, or difficulty arises."

``I will show up to analog meetings on time, and will contact the group if that is not possible."

``I will make every effort to give sufficient warning of an absence so that rescheduling is possible."

``I will speak up if I do not understand a task or am worried it is beyond my capabilities/time."
